# Monte_Carlo
This repository contains a guide to Monte Carlo simulation with mathematical proofs and python code.

The mathematical proofs and the interpretation of the results are presented in french.

The order in which the notebooks should be followed is:

1. Vol_Sphere_Riemann_Intro_Monte_Carlo.ipynb : this notebook shows the limitations of integration techniques when a considerable number of dimensions is involved. The problem of determining the volume of a sphere by the Riemann method is used as an starting point. The same problem is used to introduce the Monte Carlo methods and a discussion on the convergence velocity is presented.

2. Simulation_Stochastique_et_Methode_Rejet.ipynb : this notebook presents some elements on stochastic simulation. Methods to verify if a random variable follows a certain law are presented, as well as the Rejection Sampling method and the inversion of the cumulative distribution function.

3. Methodes_Reduction_Variance.ipynb : this notebook addresses variance reduction methods.

4. Intro_Markov_et_MCMC.ipynb : this notebook presents an introduction to Markov Chains and to Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). The Metropolis-Hastings algortihm is presented.
